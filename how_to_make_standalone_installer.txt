To make stand-alone .zip file see:

Basically this:


    ** Remove MUSHclient from the Registry in case you have been testing earlier versions
    
    Then:
    
    Use the installer to make a copy of MUSHclient on the desktop

    Open MUSHclient (the installer offers to do this)

    Wait for the spell check dictionary to be built (about 2 seconds)

    Close the various welcome and help dialogs

    Move the program around on the screen, and resize the main window, to taste

    Change any global prefs you might want, like "Notify (errors) to output window", and "confirm before closing MUSHclient".

    If you were making a custom client for a particular MUD, this would be the time to add a world file for your MUD, with the IP address, port and MUD name preconfigured. You might also add it to the global preferences "worlds to open at startup".

    Also install any plugins that you might require, and load them into your preconfigured world file.

    Close MUSHclient so screen positions and toolbar locations would be written to mushclient_prefs.sqlite and MUSHclient.ini.

    (Optional): I deleted a few files in the MUSHclient folder that I thought would confuse new users:


        mushclient.ico
        lua5.1.lib
        mushclient.gid
        uninstall.exe (not needed really since this is an installer-less version)


    Create a "logs" directory  (maybe not required now)

    Use the "SQLite Database Browser" program (http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/) to edit a few entries in the "control" table to make relative pathnames (you can't do this inside the program as it saves full pathnames). Alternatively you could use the sqlite3.exe program in a "command" window to do the same thing. Get this from: http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3_6_16.zip

    This is how you would do it with the command-line version:


    sqlite3 C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Desktop\MUSHclient\mushclient_prefs.sqlite

    UPDATE prefs   SET value = '.\logs\'           WHERE name = 'DefaultLogFileDirectory';
    UPDATE prefs   SET value = '.\worlds\'         WHERE name = 'DefaultWorldFileDirectory';
    UPDATE prefs   SET value = '.\worlds\plugins\' WHERE name = 'PluginsDirectory';
    UPDATE control SET value = 1                   WHERE name = 'First time';  -- put first-time flag back
    .quit



    In the "spell" subdirectory I deleted the 3.44 Mb file "spell.sqlite". That will be rebuilt when the player starts MUSHclient for the first time, and it adds somewhat to the .zip file size.

    Use WinZip or some compression program of your choice to make an archive of the resulting folder, making sure you preserve the directory structure.

    You now have a stand-alone distributable version!
